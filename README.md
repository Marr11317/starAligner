# StarAligner

Aligns the stars in your typescript comments.

# Usage:

Simply run `python path/to/starAligner.py path/to/your/src/`. Note that in its current implementation, this script only parses `*.ts` files. Easy enough to change though.

# WARNING

Things may go wrong! Please commit your changes before trying this script.
